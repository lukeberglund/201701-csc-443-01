### Further Exploration

#### Internet Computing

Trace the route traveled by a network request:

```` sh
tracert google.com # stop after a few seconds if necessary by pressing: control + c
````

Time the duration of a network request:

```` sh
ping google.com # stop after a few seconds if necessary by pressing: control + c
````

Download the [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) utility if necessary, then request the contents of a webpage:

```` sh
curl google.com
curl http://www.google.com
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debate-watch/twenty_sixteen/master/lib/twenty_sixteen/candidates.json
````

You may need to execute these commands from within the downloaded directory. See ["Installing cURL on Windows"](https://github.com/SCSU-CSC-Department/201701-csc-443-01/issues/13#issuecomment-285919861) for more support.
