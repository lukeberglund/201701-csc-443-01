## Open-source JavaScript Libraries

### Mongoose Overview (Optional)

Databases are not within the scope of this course. But if you're already somewhat familiar with databases and database management and you're using MongoDB in the optional extra credit project: then you'll probably benefit from a brief overview of [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/).

> Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box. - [Mongoose website](http://mongoosejs.com/)

Mongoose provides a JavaScript interface into creating, managing, and querying MongoDB databases.
