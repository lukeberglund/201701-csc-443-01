## Open-source JavaScript Libraries (Server-side)

### Express Overview

> Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. - [Express website](https://expressjs.com/)

Express provides a framework for creating web applications in Node.js. Express allows us to specify response logic that should be performed by a web server when receives requests at various URL endpoints. In this way, it is analogous to other web application micro-frameworks like [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (Python) and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) (Ruby).

#### Express Generator

Within the context of this course, there will be no need to attempt to create and configure your own Express application from scratch. Instead, we will use the Express Generator NPM package to generate a new express application for us.

When used to generate an Express application, the Express Generator provides a web application framework roughly analogous to other web application frameworks like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (Python) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) (Ruby), except not necessarily involving the database connections that those other frameworks provide.
